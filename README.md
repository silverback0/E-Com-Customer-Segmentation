# E-Com-Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation Data Science 
project aims to categorize a company's 
customer base into distinct groups to 
enhance understanding of their 
behaviors and preferences. We begin by 
collecting and cleaning customer data 
from various sources. Through 
exploratory data analysis (EDA), we 
identify key patterns and trends. 
Clustering algorithms like K-means are 
applied to segment customers based on 
features such as purchasing behavior 
and demographics. The resulting 
segments are validated for business 
relevance and presented through clear 
visualizations. We deliver a detailed 
report with recommendations for 
personalized marketing strategies and 
product offerings for each segment. 
Finally, we collaborate with stakeholders 
to implement and track the effectiveness 
of these strategies.
